# My First JS Script ever
Somehow I convinced myself to have some love for JavaScript and give it a try. Here is my first JS Script which calculates a number's parity. 

##  Usage

1. Don't Use it
2. Write your own 

## Why this ridiculous basic code exists?
I wasn't able to read JS since I'm into programming. This code exists because I managed to overcome my past issues.
I was so intended to quit programming just because I wasn't able to write / create stuff. I was feeling like I am not gonna make it.
Now I learned, every single success, every single step is another motivation source for me to move on. I did and I hope other hopeless people will be inspired by these words.
